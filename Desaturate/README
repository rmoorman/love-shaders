DESATURATE SHADER
-----------------

Basic shader showing how to desaturate an image. The shader supports
5 different ways of saturating the image; the lua side substitutes a
different method for each shader and compiles it into 5 separate love
shader objects which can then be switched between.

DESATURATION METHODS
--------------------

Lightness: corresponds to gimps "lightness" desaturation mode. Finds the largest of the r,g,b
           values and the smallest of the r,g,b values, adds them, and divides by 2.

Mean: Simple geometric mean (average.) (r + g + b)/3.

Max: Uses the largest color-channel: max(r, g, b)

Min: Uses the smallest color-channel: min(r, g, b)

Luminosity: Uses a perceptual model that takes into account how human perception interprets
            color luminosity. The coefficients are from the ITU-R BT.709 standard. This method
            is also used by many painting programs (gimp, krita, ...)
