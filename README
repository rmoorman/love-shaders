README
------

This is a small library of (mostly fragment-) shaders for love2d.
It contains the most common things that people tend to ask for.
Each shader example comes with a README and a LICENSE file. Check
those out before using the shader in your project!

Most of these shaders should be fine to use straight in your project;
they are all tested on AMD (catalyst, radeonhd, OSX), nvidia (proprietary
linux and proprietary windows) as well as intel (mesa.)
There may however be possibilities for optimization; I've not put
particular emphasis on that aspect (and prefer clarity when in doubt.)
